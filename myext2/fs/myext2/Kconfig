	help
	  MYEXT2 is a custom version of the Second Extended Filesystem with
	  magic number 0x6666 instead of 0xEF53.
	  
	  This is for educational purposes to demonstrate how to create a
	  custom filesystem based on EXT2.
	  
	  If unsure, say N.

config MYEXT2_FS_POSIX_ACL
	bool "MYEXT2 POSIX Access Control Lists"
	depends on MYEXT2_FS
	select FS_POSIX_ACL
	help
	  Posix Access Control Lists (ACLs) support permissions for users and
	  groups beyond the owner/group/world scheme.
	  
	  If you don't know what Access Control Lists are, say N.

config MYEXT2_FS_SECURITY
	bool "MYEXT2 Security Labels"
	depends on MYEXT2_FS
	help
	  Security labels support alternative access control models
	  implemented by security modules like SELinux.  This option
	  enables an extended attribute handler for file security
	  labels in the myext2 filesystem.
	  
	  If you are not using a security module that requires using
	  extended attributes for file security labels, say N.
